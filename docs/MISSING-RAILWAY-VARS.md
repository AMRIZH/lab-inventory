# üîß FIXED: .env Parsing Error

## ‚ùå **Error Resolved**
```
The environment file is invalid!
Failed to parse dotenv file. Encountered unexpected whitespace at [Lab Inventory].
```

## üîç **Root Cause**
The `.env.railway` file had unquoted values with spaces:
```bash
# ‚ùå INCORRECT (causes error)
APP_NAME=Lab Inventory
MAIL_FROM_NAME=Lab Inventory

# ‚úÖ CORRECT (fixed)
APP_NAME="Lab Inventory"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Lab Inventory"
```

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**
Updated `.env.railway` to quote all values with spaces.

```

## üîß Quick Fix - Add ALL these to Railway:

Copy and paste these exact variables to Railway environment settings:

```
BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
FILESYSTEM_DISK=local
QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
MAIL_MAILER=log
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="Lab Inventory"

```

## üö® Critical Issue:

Laravel is failing to start because these config files are trying to read environment variables that don't exist in Railway, causing the application to crash before it can serve the health check endpoint.

**Add these missing variables and Railway will automatically redeploy. The health check should then pass.**
