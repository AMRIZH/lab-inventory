# 🚂 Railway GitHub Integration Setup - Summary

**Your Lab Inventory project is now configured for Railway deployment with GitHub integration and Supabase database!**

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### 🔧 **Railway-Specific Files Created/Updated:**

1. **`railway.json`** - Railway deployment configuration
2. **`.env.railway`** - Environment template for Railway
3. **`RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide
4. **`scripts/railway-deploy-helper.bat/.sh`** - Setup helper scripts

### 🐳 **Docker Configuration Updated:**

1. **`docker-compose.yml`** - Removed PostgreSQL service (using Supabase only)
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Optimized for Railway GitHub deployment
3. **Environment variables** - Made dynamic with Railway variables

### 🌐 **Application Updates:**

1. **Health Check Route** - Added `/health` endpoint for Railway monitoring
2. **Dynamic URLs** - Support for Railway's `${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` variable
3. **Multi-environment** - Support for local, Docker, and Railway deployment

## 🚀 How to Deploy to Railway

### **Step 1: Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Connect Railway**
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Start a New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your Lab Inventory repository

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**

Copy these to Railway's environment settings:

```bash
# Application
APP_NAME=Lab Inventory
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:YOUR_GENERATED_KEY_HERE
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}

# Database (Supabase)
DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=db.your-project-ref.supabase.co
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=postgres
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_supabase_password

# Supabase
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Email URLs (automatic with Railway)
SUPABASE_REDIRECT_URL=${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}/auth/callback
SUPABASE_EMAIL_CONFIRM_REDIRECT_URL=${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}/auth/confirm
```

### **Step 4: Generate APP_KEY**
Run this command locally and copy the result:
```bash
php artisan key:generate --show
```

### **Step 5: Configure Supabase**
In Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:
- **Site URL**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- **Redirect URLs**: 
  - `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/auth/callback`
  - `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/auth/confirm`
